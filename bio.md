## About me

I am a second year graduate student in the UC Berkeley Nuclear Engineering Department, studying under Dr. Rachel Slaybaugh. My current research focuses on the simulation of nuclear reactors using deterministic and stochastic modeling approaches, though I expect my dissertation to focus on proving the feasibility incorporating modern technologies into nuclear reactor operationsâ€“both in the current reactor fleet and in the next generation of nuclear plants.

My hope is to learn how to use parallel architectures and design parallel programs for either (or better, both) projects. High fidelity ereactor simulations are currently far too complicated to be run on single machines, and my work on that project relies on Titan, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) supercomputer. While Monte Carlo programs can be embarassingly parallel, solutions of the Boltzmann neutron transport equation require more sophisticated parallelization techniques. I feel that my current understanding of writing and compiling parallel programs is limiting my ability to maximize the efficiency of my simulations. For instance, Titan allocations are based on compute hours, which include time for both CPU and GPU reservations simultaneously. Where I do not know how to make use of the GPU components, my allocations are nearly 50% inefficient. 

On the other side of things, using modern technology and advanced data analytic techniques to improve the operation of nuclear reactors is also an incredibly data intensive task. While it is likely that less formal understanding of parallel CPU/GPU programming is necessary than is required for million-computer-hour reactor simulations, the enormous amounts of data produced by reactor measurements will need to be processed by some sort of parallel system. I think it would be useful to know how to set up such systems for practical, efficient data-processing.
